        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I'm Chalwk, an independent game developer and open-source enthusiast based in New Zealand.
            With a passion for technology, I specialize in developing 2D games and engaging in a variety of coding
            projects, ranging from software engineering to research and development, and creative coding.

        <p>
            As a polymath, I have a keen interest in areas such as aerospace, mathematics, computer programming, and
            arachnology.
            My experiences have shaped my approach to problem-solving and creativity in my projects, allowing me to
            cultivate a unique perspective in both game development and technology.
