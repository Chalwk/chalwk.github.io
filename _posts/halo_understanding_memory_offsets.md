To effectively manipulate game behavior, it is crucial to understand how to locate and utilize memory addresses and
offsets.

Here is a breakdown:

* **Memory Address**: A specific location in the game's memory where data is stored.
* **Offset**: A value added to a base address to reach a particular data point.

For example, if a base address is `0x40440000`, and an offset is `0x28`, the target address would be `0x40440028`.

# Tools for Finding Offsets

Here are some tools commonly used in the Halo PC/CE modding community:

* **Cheat Engine**: A powerful tool for scanning and modifying memory addresses in real-time.
* **IDA Pro**: A disassembler and debugger for analyzing executable files.
* **Halo Map Tools 3**: A utility that simplifies the process of finding and modifying offsets within Halo maps.

# Practical Tips

* **Start with Known Values**: Identify a value in the game that you can search for, such as health or ammo count.
* **Use Cheat Engine's Scanning Features**: Utilize the "First Scan" and "Next Scan" functions to narrow down potential
  addresses.
* **Pointer Scanning**: Once you find a value, use pointer scanning to locate the base address and its offsets.
