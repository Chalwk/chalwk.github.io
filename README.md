### What I'm up to:

### Gaming:

I run **Coastal Peaks Air Service (CPAS)** - a Virtual Charter (VC) and specialty flight operator for Microsoft Flight
Simulator. We operate general aviation aircraft and helicopters for tours, charters, and HEMS missions, flying realistic
routes across New Zealand's South Island. Our flights cover Canterbury, Christchurch, Banks Peninsula, and the dramatic
landscapes of the Coast and Southern Alps, offering an experience distinct from traditional virtual airlines.
